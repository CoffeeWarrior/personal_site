# this is the repo for my website. #

This website was made with React and Typescript & is not a static webpage. I host the content from firebase.

feel free to visit me @  [hirelucasgoldman.com](hirelucasgoldman.com) 

To view how the website works [click this link]() (please note that the screen recording may have to be downloaded)

**The updateSite path only works after logging in.**

When using the updateSite path, I am able to update the posts on my homepage. It sends an api request to firebase & firebase only allows authenticated users to update the site (with myself being the only authenticatable user)
